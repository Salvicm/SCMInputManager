# SCMInputManager
Input manager for using with XinputDotNet
This package was made by Salvio Calvillo (@CalvilloSalvio in twitter) with the only intention to use it on future projects
It is not perfect nor the best implementation, I might upgrade it in the future
It uses XInputDotNetPure(https://github.com/speps/XInputDotNet/releases) and works with xbox controllers.

It allows the user to modify up to 12 input buttons between triggers, normal buttons and d-pads
Also has implementation for keyboard controller
Switch easily between keyboard and controller

Functions to allow easy modifications on the controls
Remapping available, stored in playerPrefs

Simple rumble options


-- Rename any function or variable name so that it has easy access from other scripts --
-- Serializable elements -- 
-- Serializable overload options, allows for easy testing without it loading inputs from playerprefs --

Any question refer to @CalvilloSalvio
Hope you enjoy it if you get to use it
